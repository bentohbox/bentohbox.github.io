Developed a neural network model to classify images into two categories: plane or car. Engineered a **custom dataset** by sourcing images from Google and performed comprehensive data preprocessing for optimal training results. Utilised the **Keras package** to construct the neural network and assessed model performance using **accuracy** as the primary metric.

#### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/bentohbox/bentohbox.github.io/blob/main/credit-fraud/credit-card-fraud.ipynb)

The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict if a transaction is fraudulent. To do so, I utilised **LightGBM** combined with **cross-validation** & **hyperparameter tuning** and evaluated the model performance using **AUPRC**, **Precision**, and **Specificity**. In this project, I demonstrate **data visualisation** and **machine learning** concepts. 

#### [DBA4761A Final Project: M5 Forecasting](https://github.com/bentohbox/bentohbox.github.io/blob/main/m5-forecasting-dba4761a/report_1.pdf)

Aimed at enhancing **forecasting accuracy**, my team developed a predictive model utilising hierarchical sales data from Walmart, leveraging variables such as price, promotions, and special events to forecast daily sales across stores in California, Texas, and Wisconsin. This project demonstrates the journey of a forecasting project from **data exploration**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **model evaluation**.

## Operations Research

#### [3D Container Optimisation](https://github.com/bentohbox/bentohbox.github.io/blob/main/bin-packing-problem/bin-packing-ben.ipynb)

This **supply chain optimisation** problem involves algorithmic programming to automate the placement of cargo within a specific container size. In this project, I created 2 python class objects and wrote an algorithm that packs my list of items into the container from the largest to the smallest.
