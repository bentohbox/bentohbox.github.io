Developed a neural network model to classify images into two categories: plane or car. Engineered a custom dataset by sourcing images from Google and performed comprehensive data preprocessing for optimal training results. Utilised the Keras package to construct the neural network and assessed model performance using accuracy as the primary metric.

#### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/bentohbox/bentohbox.github.io/blob/main/credit-fraud/credit-card-fraud.ipynb)

The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict if a transaction is fraudulent. To do so, I utilised LightGBM combined with cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning and evaluated the model performance using AUPRC, Precision, and Specificity. In this project, I demonstrate data visualisation and machine learning concepts.
