#### Plane or Car? Image Classification with Neural Networks
Developed a neural network model to classify images into two categories: plane or car. Engineered a custom dataset by sourcing images from Google and performed comprehensive data preprocessing for optimal training results. Utilised the Keras package to construct the neural network and assessed model performance using accuracy as the primary metric.
